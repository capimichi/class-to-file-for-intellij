# Class to file

This is a simple class to file converter, born to work with intellij environments.

## Installation

```bash
$ curl "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/capimichi/class-to-file-for-intellij/main/class_to_file.sh" > /usr/local/bin/class_to_file
$ chmod +x /usr/local/bin/class_to_file
```

Then you need to create the external command on intellij:

## Usage

```bash
$ class_to_file "source_path.ext" "class_content"
```
